Finding a DNA fragment in a suspect sequence

Pseudocode
    sourceFile_sequence = file containing suspect sequence gained from user
    variable(sequence) = read file
    sourceFile_fragment = file containing fragment
    variable(fragment) = read file
    variable(fragLocation) = find in sequence(fragment)


Variables
    sourceFile_sequence         is the file taken from the user containing the suspect sequence
    sequence                    is the continents of sourceFile_sequence read to a string
    sourceFile_fragment         is the file taken from the user containing the DNA fragment
    fragment                    is the continents of sourceFile_fragment read to a string
    fragLocation                used to store the location of the DNA fragment
